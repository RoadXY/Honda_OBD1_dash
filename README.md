# Honda OBD1 - Smart Dashboard & Data Logger

An ESP32-based intelligent dashboard and data logger for a Honda engines using chipped OBD1 ECU (P06, P28, P30, P72 etc) making use of the eCtune/HTS ISRv3 datalogging protocol.

## 🚗 Project Overview
This project gives the driver essential data on a screen while driving. 
It also can serve (optional) as a bridge between a classic Honda OBD1 ECU and modern IoT capabilities. It provides real-time engine monitoring, automatic data logging to SD-card, and wireless battery health monitoring.

### Vehicle Specifications:
Any Honda engine with chipped OBD1 ECU with eCtune or Honda Tuning Suite (ISRv3 protocol)

## 🛠 Features
- **Live Datalogging:** Bluetooth Serial communication with the P06 ECU using the Honda Tuning Suite protocol (38400 Baud).
- **WiFi Connectivity:**
  - Automatic time synchronization via NTP.
  - Periodic battery voltage reporting to MQTT.
- **Smart Power Management:** - Deep Sleep mode with multiple wakeup triggers (Ignition/Contact, Physical button, and Hourly timer).
- **Storage & Config:** - Dynamic configuration via `settings.txt` on SD-card.
  - Automatic NVS (Non-Volatile Storage) updates for persistent settings.
- **Visuals:** 1.9" 170x320 SPI Display (ST7789) for real-time gauge rendering and changing basis settings.
